# nRF51-sdk

This repository contains an old SDK I once compiled for more convenient nRF51822 firmware development.

This repo is abandoned.
It will be kept live here, since there seem to be some users out there, and for historic purposes.
It is unlikely to receive any updates though,
since all future nRF51822 development happens with Apache MyNewt,
see also these links:
